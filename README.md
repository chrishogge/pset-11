### Exercise 1 (`findMe`)

Find the specified number in the list and return the index at which that number is located. For lists that contain more than one instance of the number, you should return the index of the first occurrence of the number. If the number is not found, return `-1`. Your solution must be an implementation of a linear search algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

### Exercise 2 (`findMe`)

Find the specified `String` in the list and return the index at which that `String` is located. For lists that contain more than one instance of the `String`, you should return the index of the first occurrence of the `String`. If the `String` is not found, return `-1`. Your solution must be an implementation of a linear search algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

### Exercise 3 (`findMeFaster`)

Find the specified number in the list and return the index at which that number is located. For lists that contain more than one instance of the number, you may return the index of the number that is located first. If the number is not found, return `-1`. Your solution must be an implementation of a binary search algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. Assume all lists, if not `null`, are already sorted in ascending order.

### Exercise 4 (`findMeFaster`)

Find the specified `String` in the list and return the index at which that `String` is located. For lists that contain more than one instance of the `String`, you may return the index of the `String` that is located first. If the `String` is not found, return `-1`. Your solution must be an implementation of a binary search algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. Assume all lists, if not `null`, are already sorted in ascending order; `null` values appear at the end of the list.

### Exercise 5 (`bubble`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

Use the provided `grademe.sh` script to verify your code against my test cases (coming soon).

### Exercise 6 (`bubble`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. When sorted in both ascending and descending order, `null` values should always be placed at the end of the list.

### Exercise 7 (`insertion`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

Use the provided `grademe.sh` script to verify your code against my test cases (coming soon).

### Exercise 8 (`insertion`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. When sorted in both ascending and descending order, `null` values should always be placed at the end of the list.

### Exercise 9 (`selection`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the selection sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

Use the provided `grademe.sh` script to verify your code against my test cases (coming soon).

### Exercise 10 (`selection`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be an implementation of the selection sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. When sorted in both ascending and descending order, `null` values should always be placed at the end of the list.

### Exercise 11 (`merge`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be a recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible.

### Exercise 12 (`merge`)

Sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and return the sorted list. Your solution must be a recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm, and must account for `null` values wherever possible. When sorted in both ascending and descending order, `null` values should always be placed at the end of the list.
